# Education Inequality
An exploratory data analysis(EDA) on education inequality of differenet countries
Most of the project focuses on data cleaning
Especially handling missing values
For this project, There were more than 50% missing values
In order to handle them:
I determined the proportion of missing values first based on rows and then columns
Countries with more than 30% of missing values were dropped
This caused a significant loss of data
But as in real-life project, That is what happens usually
